    # This solve() method is called by label.py, so you should keep the interface the
    #  same, but you can change the code itself. 
    # It's supposed to return a list with two elements:
    #
    #  - The first element is a list of part-of-speech labelings of the sentence.
    #    Each of these is a list, one part of speech per word of the sentence.
    #    Most algorithms only return a single labeling per sentence, except for the
    #    mcmc sampler which is supposed to return 5.
    #
    #  - The second element is a list of probabilities, one per word. This is
    #    only needed for max_marginal() and is the marginal probabilities for each word.
